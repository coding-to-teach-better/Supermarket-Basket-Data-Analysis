# Supermarket-Basket-Data-Analysis

Analysis of supermarket basket data using python and mySQL.

Python is used to create a mySQL database, clean and transform the raw supermarket basket data, and automate importing the transformed data into tables within the database. mySQL is then used to query said tables.

Prices were not included in the dataset so random prices were generated within a reasonable range.
